# Hints

- Solution may take into consideration if it is Case Sensitive: "God" is not permutation of "dog";
- Solution may take whitespace into account: "God    " is not permutation of "Dog";
- Strings of different lengths are not permutations of one another;
- Ordering the arrays and both being equal, one is a swap of the other;
